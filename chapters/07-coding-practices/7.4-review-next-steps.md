# **7.4 Review & Next Steps**

### **7.4.1 Pattern Selection Checklist (1-Minute Review)**

Use this checklist before starting a new module:

1. Is the domain simple? → **Modular/Procedural**.  
2. Do you need strict auditability? → **Event Sourcing**.  
3. Is it read-heavy/performance-critical? → **CQRS**.  
4. Are there multiple teams on one domain? → **DDD**.  
5. Does the UI need real-time sync? → **MVVM \+ WebSockets**.

### **7.4.2 Summary**

* Start with the **Pragmatic Layered Architecture** (Modular Monolith \+ Repositories).  
* Add complexity (CQRS, DDD) only when metrics or business rules demand it.  
* Keep your "Driver Methods" clean by refactoring logic into small, testable private functions.  
* Use AI as a force multiplier, but anchor it with strict schemas and tests.
